## 📚 About

This repository is a **complete C programming practice resource** for beginners. Whether you're just starting your programming journey or revising C for academic or interview purposes, these programs will help you master:

- Loops & conditionals  
- Functions & recursion  
- Arrays & strings  
- Pointers  
- Structures  
- Basic data structures (stack, queue, linked list)  
- Algorithmic thinking

## 🗂️ Folder & File Structure

All files are organized in a flat structure with descriptive filenames:

```

/
├── Binary Search.c
├── Bubble Sort.c
├── Factorial (Recursion).c
├── Fibonacci.c
├── Stack using Array.c
├── Queue (Circular).c
├── Singly Linked List.c
├── Tower of Hanoi.c
├── Palindrome Checker.c
└── ...

````

(*Consider organizing files into folders in future updates like: `arrays/`, `recursion/`, `linked_lists/`, etc.*)

---

## 🧪 How to Use

You can compile and run any file using a C compiler like `gcc`:

```bash
gcc "Bubble Sort.c" -o bubble
./bubble
````

💡 Make sure your compiler supports standard C (C89/C99 or above).

## 🧠 Sample Code

```c
// Simple C program to calculate factorial using recursion
#include <stdio.h>
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
int main() {
    int num = 5;
    printf("Factorial of %d = %d\n", num, factorial(num));
    return 0;
}
```
